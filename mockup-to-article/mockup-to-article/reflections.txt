  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!
1) As it is just the beginning and I'm just getting started all I can say about the learning curve is pretty much very needed basic which everyone has to know. Things like, what a web page is, what things contributes on making a web page, a web page is what i think I've learned. 
And yeah, pretty basic HTML.
2) Easy part was proper guidance and explanation on what we're supposed to do. Till now. I don't know if this is how entire course
is going to be. If it is, then, I'll love it even more.
3) Keeping up and trying to come back finish what I started. Yes. For now, I guess we need to be just patient enough to look
for answers and search.
4) Not really, a problem was simple. All I did was go through each and every instruction carefully and try to figure out
how to search for an answer or rather how to break answers into multiple answers so that I know what I'm doing. If it makes any sense at all.
